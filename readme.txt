= Isn't that duplicate content?  =

No. The original post has the publication timestamp changed.  There remains only only copy of the post.

= If you change the timestamp won't that affect my pretty permalinks which include dates?  =

Yes it will.  Did you read the warning? This plugin should no be used with permalink structures that include dates. This is yet another reason why you should not use such a structure.  

= What is the plugin page?  =
